# Power Method Solutions

A first project for my work in the Lab of Dr. Jussi Eloranta at California State University at Northridge. 

Herein, I bring myself up to speed with regard to iterative power method solutions to eigenproblems. 


# Simple Power Method

1. Choose a random normalized starting vector, *y*
2. while some convergence criteria is not satisfied
    1. solve the linear equation A *y*=*x*
    1. normalize *x*
    1. set *y* to *x*

# Methodologies
As this is the first project, it is also about developing a work methodology.
